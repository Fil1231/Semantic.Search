# Semantic Search for a Website

This project demonstrates how to implement semantic search functionality for a website. Semantic search goes beyond simple keyword matching by understanding the context and intent behind user queries, providing more relevant and accurate search results.

## Features
- Indexes website content for semantic understanding
- Processes user queries using natural language processing (NLP)
- Returns contextually relevant search results
- Easy integration with existing websites

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- pip (Python package manager)
- (Optional) Docker for containerized deployment

### Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Semantic.Search
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage
1. Prepare your website content (HTML, markdown, or plain text files).
2. Run the semantic search indexer to process your content.
3. Start the search server:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
4. Access the search interface at `http://localhost:8000` (or your configured port).

## Example Query
- "Find articles about machine learning applications in healthcare."
- "Show me tutorials on semantic search."

## Technologies Used
- Python
- FastAPI or Flask (for the web server)
- Sentence Transformers or similar NLP models
- FAISS or similar vector search libraries

## Customization
- You can adapt the indexing script to your website's content format.
- Swap out the NLP model for your preferred transformer or embedding model.
